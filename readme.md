### This is an example project for https://github.com/Zode/KCC

This showcases how you can build your own controller with the KCC plugin. See the included `test1` scene. This very same project was used in testing the plugin while developing it.

The project has been set up with the following controls:  
- mouse look
- WASD move
- space jump
- 1 to teleport to a moving platform
